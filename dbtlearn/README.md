The folder structure of a dbt project is typically organized into the following layers:

* **Sources:** This folder contains the YAML configuration files that define your data sources, such as databases, cloud storage buckets, and API endpoints.
* **Models:** This folder contains the SQL files that define your data transformations. Models are typically grouped into subfolders based on their purpose, such as staging, intermediate, and marts.
* **Tests:** This folder contains the SQL files that define your data tests. Tests are used to verify the correctness of your data transformations.
* **Docs:** This folder contains documentation for your dbt project, such as README files, model descriptions, and diagrams.
* **Scripts:** This folder contains scripts for automating tasks such as running dbt, deploying your data warehouse, and loading data into your warehouse.

**Staging models** are typically used to load raw data from your sources into your data warehouse. They may also perform basic transformations such as cleaning and formatting the data.

**Intermediate models** are used to create more complex transformations, such as joining tables from different sources or performing calculations.

**Mart models** are used to create the final data marts that will be used by your analysts and data scientists. Mart models typically aggregate data from intermediate models and may also perform more complex transformations such as calculating metrics and dimensions.

In addition to the above folders, you may also have other folders in your dbt project, such as:

* **Macros:** This folder contains SQL macros that can be reused in your models.
* **Profiles:** This folder contains configuration files that define the different environments in which your dbt project can be run, such as development, staging, and production.
* **Dependencies:** This folder contains any external dependencies that your dbt project needs, such as custom Python packages or SQL functions.

The specific folder structure that you use for your dbt project will depend on your specific needs and requirements. However, the above structure is a good starting point for most projects.

Here is an example of a simple dbt project folder structure:

```
my_dbt_project/
├── dbt_project.yml

│   ├── staging/
│   │   ├── users.sql
│   │   ├── products.sql
│   ├── intermediate/
